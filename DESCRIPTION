Description: Runs a simulation of a Monty Hall game. A contestant has three doors to pick from, two with a goat behind them, and one with a car behind it. After the contestant chooses their initial door, the host opens one goat door. After the goat door is revealed, the contestant is given the option of staying with the door they originally chose, or switching to the remaining door. If the door they select has a car behind it, they win the game. If the door they select has a goat behind it, they lose the game. A quick simulation of 100 randomized Monty Hall games can be run with differing strategies to determine whether staying or switching doors results in more games being won.
